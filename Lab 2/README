#Objective of the Lab:
The purpose of this experiment is to exhibit some of the capabilities of generating pulses at the ports of the PIC18F4520. This goal was achieved by writing four different assembly programs that generate pulse trains at bins RA3 and RC3 of the microcontroller. 
Each pulse train had a different duty cycle and/or a period. Even though there were four types of pulse trains, the same pulse train was generated at RA3 as well as RC3 at a given task.
